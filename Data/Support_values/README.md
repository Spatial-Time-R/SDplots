We calculated support values using the SH test (Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999)) for all internal branches of our phylogeny. The branches in the phylogenetic tree on which sweep-related substitutions occurred are associated with support values, which we plotted in a [histogram](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots/blob/master/Data/Support_values/histogram_SH_values.pdf) against support values that are associated with non-sweep-related changes. In addition to that, we repeatedly subsampled protein sites to reinfer phylogenies to evaluate the support of each branch. We plotted this information in a [histogram](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/SDplots/blob/master/Data/Support_values/histogram_subsample_values.pdf), too.
